_This is a copy of an old Othits newsletter_

We are happy to push forward the autosurf world by providing you the Otohits API. Officially launched today, it is a brand new way to use and manage your links and data, but also a new tool that allows you to imagine, create and share new solutions for an optimal use of Otohits.

4 services are already available and, we will push to add a lot more. Libraries should appear soon to help you use the API. You want one in your favorite language? Don't hesitate to tell us, or even better, to create it. We will be happy to make it available for everyone.

Some features on the website already use the API (all the options under the Actions button on the "My sites" page and the throttling) and we are eager to discover your ideas for it.
You will find all the information for the API on his dedicated page: [https://www.otohits.net/account/api](https://www.otohits.net/account/api)

Concerning the throttling, some members wanted a bit more than a static limit. We decided to bring you a much more advanced solution. You are now able to set the number of visits hour by hour and decide if you want a static number of visits or a ranged one, for each hour. Time zones are also supported to help you create natural flow of visits for your location.

As promised in the last newsletter, extensive work has been conducted on the "My sites" page. Here are the main changes:
- The interface has been refreshed to handle links more easily.
- Option icons have been updated for all the primary features.
- You can now change the option for multiple links at once with the "Actions" button.

Slots are now available in the shop. If purchased, they will be added to your account permanently.

The support of the V3.0 application has been slightly extended. But keep in mind that it will cease to work really soon (mid-December). If you didn't install the V3.1 already, we suggest you do it quickly.

Thanks to some members, we identified a bug which is now fixed on the latest version (3104). A new parameter (/nowebgl) is now available to make the application work on specific configurations (application stuck on "sending order to the browser" message).

As usual, thank you all for your participation and hello to all the members who joined us recently. Thanks to all of you, we now regularly generate more than 20 million hits per day!

Have a good surf.
