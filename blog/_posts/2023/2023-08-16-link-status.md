## The different status of a link

There are 4 possible status for a link on Otohits:

* **Waiting for validation**: the link has been added and need to be reviewed by the webmaster. It will not be visible in the autosurf until it has been validated. Some domains are on a white list, meaning that they will be validated immediately after the submission
* **Validated**: The link has been reviewed. You can add points to it and it will be visible in the autosurf
* **Refused**: The link does work properly or not match the rules described in the T.O.S. A refused link can be deleted by the member in his "My sites" page. If not, the link will be automatically removed after a few months
* **Paused**: the link is validated but it has been paused by the members. It will not be visible in the autosurf

## Why the status of my link changed after it has been validated?

There could be some reason that even if your link is validated, his status can be changed by the webmaster:

* The link has been reported from other members, its status will change to `Waiting for validation`. It will be reviewed by the webmaster.
* If the content of the link does not match the T.O.S even after the validation, it will be marked as `Refused`.
* If your link blocks the autosurf (too many requests, coin miner), it will be marked as `Refused`.
