## Safe link

This category regroups links that are considered safe. Every member can surf on them with the Application without any issue.

### Rules of the Safe category

* The link needs to have real content. Empty links will be considered as `PTP`.
* The link should not display too many ads. Common limit is 3 banners/popin for a page. The ads should also remain light and come from quality ad networks.
* You should avoid using URL shorteners. Some well-known shorteners like `bit.ly` or `goog.le` will work, but less known shorteners will make the link to be considered as `PTP`
* The link should not produce too much HTTP requests or CPU usage, otherwise, it might be considered as `PTP`

## PTP link

The origin of this category name comes from a long time ago, when autosurfs were heavily used with `Paid to promote` pages that mainly displayed a lot of ads.

`PTP` is now referring to any link that could be heavy in terms of ads, resource usages and propose no real content.

### Why is link my considered as PTP?

There are multiple reasons a link can be forced to PTP category:

* It has no real content is present on your link
  * Blank page or very low value content
  * Slow loading
* It makes too much HTTP requests (>1000)
* It redirects to other domains or use URL shorteners
* It is hosted on Blogspot
* The whitelist contains one or more domains that have been identified as `PTP` and your link is loading them. Note that it is verified on HTTP requests made, so it can be an ad network domain that is considered as `PTP` that may force it on your link.

## With Sound link

If your link comes up with any sound of any kind, it will fall into this category.

This category prevails over `PTP`. 

## Adult link

If any adult content is detected on your link or if one whitelisted domain as `Adult` is loaded, the link will be set in this category.

This category prevails over any other category.

## Notes
* The webmaster can change the status of a website at any moment. The main objective is to make the surf as good as possible for all members
* Don't hesitate to contact the webmaster if you think that your website has not been validated under the correct category
* You can choose which category you want to surf on with your Application on your [Settings page](https://www.otohits.net/account/myinfos). If you have links on a category, but you don't activate it to surf on, it may lower your surf ratio
