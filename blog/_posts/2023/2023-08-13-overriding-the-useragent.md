## What is the user-agent?

User-agent is like a signature of your browser. With the user-agent, a website knows which browser you are using.

Here is an example of a user-agent: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0`

The above example shows you the Firefox 31 user-agent.

You can check your current user-agent on the follwing website: [https://whatmyuseragent.com/](https://whatmyuseragent.com/)

## Why should I change the user-agent?

Most of statistics and traffic tools can easily look at the user-agents that came on your website. When the same user-agent is always used, it's easier to suspect low quality traffic. 

Changing the user-agent will bring you more natural visits, made with multiple user-agent and you can even simulate visits from mobile phones or tablets.

## How it works?

When the Application is started, it will automatically and randomly take a default user-agent. This is to avoid having the same one for every Application and introduce some variety.

You can also choose manually the user-agents to be used on your links.

* Go to your my sites page
* Click on the configuration button ![Config button](/img/guides/config_btn.png) of one of your links and click on advanced options and info
* Find the `Change the user-agent` row and enable it

![Change user-agent referer row](/img/guides/change_ua_1.png)

* You will see a table with a row below to add a new user-agents. You can also select pre-made user-agents from the suggestion list

* In the example below, I chose to recieve 50% of the visits with an iPhone user-agent and the other 50% with Firefox user-agent
