_This is a copy of an old Othits newsletter_

First feedbacks for the V3 of the Application are pretty good. Despite few minor issues, it seems to run pretty well. Clicks and auto scroll on pages will be normally introduced early September.

This looks like the right time to introduce back our contests.
As such, 2 new contests will be launched for September:
- 50€ will be shared among best recruiters
- 50€ for the best surfers
Get your social skills and surf instances ready for the event!

In the next few days, the points obtained by buying packages in the shop will be lowered. Prices will remain the same but the amount of point obtained will decrease. This is to improve the balance of points in circulation on the platform.
To provide more flexibility for payments, a new system has been added : SuperRewards. You will be able to buy points with numerous payment systems (credit cards, mobile, bitcoins, Skrill and many others) and also have the opportunity to win some points too without paying anything by answering some offers. Don't hesitate to have a look on the shop page.

As usual, thank you all for your participation and hello to all the members who joined us recently.

Have a good surf,
