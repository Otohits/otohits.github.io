_This is a copy of an old Othits newsletter_

The update of the website and the application went well yesterday.

For information, here are the main changes:
- The application now comes with an automatic updater. If a new version comes out, it will download it, install it and then relaunch the application. By default, if your application is not launched, it will launch it automatically as well.
If you don't want to use the auto-updater or the auto-launch features, please read the FAQ of the Otohits App.
- The old version of the application will not work anymore at the end of the next week. It gives you time to migrate your instances. From the new version, you will be noticed if your version is not up to date and you don't use the auto-updater. A red message will be displayed at the bottom of the application.
- A new portable version is available. You can download it, unzip it wherever you want. It will download automatically the latest version.
- The application now supports random user-agent. This is a huge improvement as it will deliver to your website more "natural" visits. A new section is available on the detail page of your websites. If you do not activate the feature, Otohits will pick a random user-agent for your website. By activating the feature, you will be able to add any user-agent you want.
- 2 new articles will be added soon to explain the user-agent and referer override features.

Please do not hesitate to report any issue with all these new features.

Have a good surf.
