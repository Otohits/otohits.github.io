_This is a copy of an old Othits newsletter_

This is a quick message to inform you that some members encountered issues with the new version of the application.
Even though not everyone is impacted, I don't like the idea of leaving too much people behind.

I decided to disable the new feature brought by the new version of the application (user-agent override) until the issue is fixed.
If the version 2.1.0.0 is working well for you, you can continue to use it.
If not, you will find a link on the application page to download the 2.0.0.0 version which is still working.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience and be sure that I will do my best to fix the issue as soon as possible.

Have a good day.
